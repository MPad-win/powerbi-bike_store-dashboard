📊 Executive Summary – Bike Store Dashboard Insights

Bike Store Sales Dashboard built in Power BI from raw data. Includes key KPIs, category and store performance, monthly sales trends, and top customer analysis. Designed to highlight revenue patterns, seasonality, and improvement opportunities across product categories and store locations.

🔍 1. Total Sales Performance

Total Sales: $8M

Total Orders: 1.6K

Total Customers: 1,445

Average Order Value (AOV): $4.76K

Insight:

Sales volume is solid relative to the customer base.
AOV is high because customers typically buy high-ticket items (bikes).

Recommendation:

Focus retention strategies on existing customers — even a small lift in repeat purchase rate would significantly grow revenue due to high AOV.

🚴 2. Sales by Category

Mountain Bikes dominate the catalog with nearly $3M in revenue, more than Road Bikes and Cruisers combined.

Insight:

The business is heavily dependent on one product segment.
Electric Bikes and Cyclocross Bikes show moderate performance but still lag far behind.

Recommendations:

Expand marketing campaigns around Mountain Bikes (highest ROI).

Investigate why Electric Bikes underperform — consider pricing, marketing, and stock availability.

Diversify the product mix to reduce reliance on a single category.

🏬 3. Sales by Store

Baldwin Bikes is the top store, generating almost 6× more sales than Rowlett Bikes.

Santa Cruz Bikes performs moderately.

Rowlett Bikes significantly underperforms.

Insight:

Major performance gap between stores suggests operational, demographic, or inventory differences.

Recommendations:

Conduct a store-level deep dive:

Are high-performing stores carrying more profitable categories?

Is there stronger local demand?

Are sales teams performing differently?

Implement performance benchmarks across all locations.

Improve Rowlett Bikes’ assortment or marketing approach.

📅 4. Monthly Sales Trend

Peaks in April with sales above $1M.

Sharp decline in May.

Stable but lower performance from June to December.

Insight:

Seasonality plays a major role — demand spikes early in the year, then stabilizes.

Recommendations:

Allocate marketing and inventory ahead of spring.

Introduce late-year promotions to reduce the long low-sales period.

Consider seasonal models (ARIMA/Prophet) to predict inventory needs.

🧍 5. Top Customers

The top 10 customers generate a disproportionately high share of revenue.

Leading customers (e.g., Larson, Pena, Joyner) are all repeat high-value buyers.

Insight:

Revenue is concentrated — losing even 1–2 key customers could significantly impact total sales.

Recommendations:

Implement a VIP customer retention program:

Early access to new models

Exclusive discounts

Loyalty points

Target similar demographic profiles to acquire more high-value customers.
